# Docker Runbook

Primary runbook:
- [`docker.md`](../../docker.md)

This file points to the full Docker pipeline instructions in the repository root. That runbook includes:
1. General Docker environment setup and launch
2. How to run normal Python commands once inside the container
3. Every stage/substage command with explicit inputs, outputs, and expected behavior
4. QA/report commands and artifact export

This project will eventually be trained on a remote 40GB A100 via docker, as no root access to the GPU is granted. You will need to keep this in mind and implement the corresponding docker infrastructure throughout your implementation of the project, as well as a detailed guide of which commands to run, what they will output and where.
Code in human format: it is very important that your code is concise. Don't do extensive try/catches, etc. We want short, clear code.
You should ensure that we reach a clear, verifiable "state" at the end of each step of the plan (e.g., normalized photos should be saved and independently visualisable rather than stored only within the pipeline) in between each of the plan's steps. Things should be modular and verifiable.
For hyperparameters and most arguments, use yaml config files - only use cli params for things that are highly likely to often be modified (e.g. direction directory) The idea is to have a limited number of cli params per step.
Use docstrings consistently, on all functions and files/methods, but keep them shorts - one or two lines explaining briefly what it does, and describe only whatever parameters are not obvious to understand.
